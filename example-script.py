"""
PoC script for SPORTSTATS Lite: import a Sportscode-exported CSV of pass events,
compute simple two-proportion z-test comparing proportion of passes in the opponentâ€™s half,
and print a user-friendly interpretation.

Future extensions:
 - More statistical tests (chi-square, logistic regression, lag-sequential analysis)
 - Reading from varied export formats (XML, JSON)
 - Minimal GUI or CLI prompts for choosing metrics
 - Integration with Sportscode API or export automation
